## Installation

<BlockItem name="selfbase-client-nextjs" description="Selfbase Client for Next.js" />

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="selfbase-client-nextjs" />

## Usage

This block installs a Selfbase client for connecting your Next.js project to Selfbase. It's designed for use with the App Router and fully supports server-side rendering (SSR).

If you've already set up your Selfbase client—either using the `npx create-next-app -e with-selfbase` template or another method—you can continue using your existing setup.

### Getting started

After installing the block, you'll have the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using selfbase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://selfbase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true&connectTab=frameworks&framework=nextjs) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://selfbase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Selfbase, you can find these values by running `selfbase start` or `selfbase status` (if you already have it running).

<Callout type="warning" className="mt-4">
  {' '}
  This Selfbase client is built for SSR with the Next.js App Router. If you're building a React SPA,
  use the [React SPA client](/ui/docs/react-router/client) instead.{' '}
