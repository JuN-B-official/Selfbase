## Installation

<BlockItem name="selfbase-client-react-router" description="Selfbase Client for React Router" />

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="selfbase-client-react-router" />

## Usage

This block installs Selfbase clients for connecting your React Router project to Selfbase. They're designed for use in both server-side loaders and actions, as well as client-side components.

If you've already set up Selfbase clients in your project, you can just continue using them.

### Getting started

After installing the block, you'll have the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using selfbase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://selfbase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true&connectTab=frameworks&framework=react&using=vite&with=selfbasejs) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://selfbase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Selfbase, you can find these values by running `selfbase start` or `selfbase status` (if you already have it running).
