## Installation

<BlockItem name="selfbase-client-react" description="Selfbase Client for React SPA" />

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="selfbase-client-react" />

## Usage

This block installs a Selfbase client for connecting your React project to Selfbase. It's designed for use in client-side components.

If you've already set up a Selfbase client in your project, you can just continue using that existing setup.

### Getting started

After installing the block, you'll have the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using selfbase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://selfbase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true&connectTab=frameworks&framework=react&using=vite&with=selfbasejs) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://selfbase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Selfbase, you can find these values by running `selfbase start` or `selfbase status` (if you already have it running).
